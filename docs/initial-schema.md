# Database Schema Plan - Travel Baseball SaaS

### How to use this Schema

1. **Start with the migrations:** Create these tables in the order listed (Users/Orgs first, then Settings, then Players, then Teams).
2. **Add Indexes:** Add indexes to every `organization_id` and `season_id` column. Your app will query these columns on _every single page load_.
3. **Use UUIDs (Optional):** Consider using UUIDs for IDs (`$table->uuid('id')`) if you want to make it harder for people to guess URLs (e.g., `app.com/teams/5` vs `app.com/teams/9d8f...`).
4. **JSON Columns:** Use the `schema` and `data` JSON columns for the Form Builder. This saves you from creating a complex "EAV" (Entity-Attribute-Value) table structure for custom questions.
